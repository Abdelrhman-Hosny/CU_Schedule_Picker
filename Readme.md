# Description

This is a program that allows user to make schedules , user has to enter the events that are happening and the program will output all possible schedules with no time clashes and from then , It's up to you to pick the one that suits you the most.

## How to use

I can sum it up by saying that you can enter the info about each subject i.e. code , day , time ..etc
However Here are some tips that I would advise you to do :

* Don't just add all subject at once , what I mean is for example let's say you have two subjects "MTH" & "CMP"
  Fill all the available MTH lectures then save it to a folder and clear all items and do the same for CMP
  this will result in you being able to load MTH and CMP at anytime from the files they were saved in
  **This is shown in the video I posted**

* Before saving check that all the subjects are registered properly as any error in time / name / day will result in not getting all the possible schedules

* **Most Importantly : Time follows the 24-Hour Format**

* After that simply click on Print and It'll print the possible schedules into the file that you named like so :
